# CHAT_SERVER_WITH_FILE_TRANSFER

Hi I am Rahul Roshan G. Find something new here where you can chat server with file transfer. Here the file transfer happens this way when you press the button "Open .txt file" you will get an writing option in command line[if we have "cl1" and "cl2" if you press that button in "cl1" it shows option to type the name in cl1 command line only] to type the file that should be transfer and NOTE you can only send text file. So if you type the file name then it will show all the contents to other user or clients but all clients will get the name of the file and the junk value before or after it. I have used tkinter, python and socket programming here for user
legible. Run the server first but first change the ip address of the server from "127.0.0.1" or local host to you ip address in both server and client [enter the server's ip address in the client file so that it connects to server with no issue]. After that run client server you will get an GUI to enter the username enter that and you can't change the username again. After that type the message in below box and press the button to send.

Happy coding.
