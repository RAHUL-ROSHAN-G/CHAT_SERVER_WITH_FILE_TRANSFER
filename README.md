# CHAT_SERVER_WITH_FILE_TRANSFER
Hi I am Rahul Roshan G. Find something new here where you can chat server with file transfer. Here the file transfer happens this way when you press the button "Open .txt file" you will get an writing option in command line[if we have "cl1" and "cl2" if you press that button in "cl1" it shows option to type the name in cl1 command line only] to type the file that should be transfer and NOTE you can only send text file. So if you type the file name then it will show all the contents to other user or clients but all clients will get the name of the file and the junk value before or after it. 

Happy coding.
